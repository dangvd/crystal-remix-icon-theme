# Crystal Remix icon theme

[Releases](https://github.com/dangvd/crystal-remix-icon-theme/releases)

Crystal Remix is a Crystal icon theme for modern Linux desktop environments, created from KDE 3's Crystal Project and Crystal Clear icon themes (mainly Crystal Project). Personally, I think Crystal is the best ever icon theme for the Linux desktop, and I'd like to be able to continue using it.
